You may want to replace them with your own. The following sections will guide you to create and replace the default favicons.


## AirDash Data Table Documentation
Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for AirDash's Data Table component. This guide will walk you through every aspect of effectively utilizing this tool to visualize and manipulate your JSON data.

# 1.Introduction
## Purpose of the AirDash Data Table
The AirDash Data Table component serves as an interactive interface for presenting and managing tabular JSON data. It's designed to help users view, edit, and interact with structured data in a user-friendly manner within the AirDash project.

## Key Benefits
**Clear Visualization:** The AirDash Data Table presents JSON data in an organized manner, enhancing understanding and analysis.

**Effortless Editing:** Users can directly edit cell values, with real-time updates to the JSON data source.

**Contextual Actions:** Customizable row actions empower users to perform specific actions on individual JSON data items.

**Multi-Item Selection:** Checkbox selection allows bulk actions and data analysis on selected JSON items.

**Automatic Sorting:** Rows can be sorted based on columns with a single click.


# 2. Basic Usage
## Displaying Data
Integrate your data into the Data Table during initialization. It will automatically convert the data into a tabular layout for display.

## Sorting Data
Enable automatic sorting on columns by clicking on column headers, making data exploration more convenient.

## Selecting Items
Users can select items using checkboxes, allowing for operations on multiple items or efficient data analysis.

# 3. Editing Data
## Enabling Editing Mode
Activate the editing mode to enable users to edit cell values directly within the table.

## Editing Values
Users can click on cells and modify their content. Changes are immediately reflected in the data.

## Saving and Canceling Edits
Provide options to save or cancel edits, ensuring a seamless editing experience.

# 4. Row Operations
## Adding Custom Operations
Enhance user interaction by adding custom operations to each row, like "Edit," "Delete," or other context-specific actions for each data item.

## Defining Operation Handlers
Implement event handlers for custom operations, executing the corresponding actions when users interact with them.

# 5. Checkbox Selection
## Enabling Checkboxes
Allow checkbox selection for rows, making batch operations and manipulation of selected items more convenient.

## Selecting Multiple Items
Users can select multiple data items using checkboxes, simplifying processes involving multiple selections.

# 6. Item Deletion
## Allowing Item Deletion

Enable item deletion functionality, empowering users to delete data items as needed.

## Confirming Deletion
Implement confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletion of data items.

# 7. Advanced Features
## Custom Styling

## Generate the favicon

Prepare a square image (PNG, JPG, or SVG) with a size of 512x512 or more, and then go to the online tool [**Real Favicon Generator**](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and click the button <kbd>Select your Favicon image</kbd> to upload your image file.

In the next step, the webpage will show all usage scenarios. You can keep the default options, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the button <kbd>Generate your Favicons and HTML code</kbd> to generate the favicon.

## Download & Replace

Download the generated package, unzip and delete the following two from the extracted files:

- `browserconfig.xml`{: .filepath}
- `site.webmanifest`{: .filepath}

And then copy the remaining image files (`.PNG`{: .filepath} and `.ICO`{: .filepath}) to cover the original files in the directory `assets/img/favicons/`{: .filepath} of your Jekyll site. If your Jekyll site doesn't have this directory yet, just create one.

The following table will help you understand the changes to the favicon files:

| File(s)             | From Online Tool                  | From Chirpy |
|---------------------|:---------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| `*.PNG`             | ✓                                 | ✗           |
| `*.ICO`             | ✓                                 | ✗           |

>  ✓ means keep, ✗ means delete.
{: .prompt-info }

The next time you build the site, the favicon will be replaced with a customized edition.
