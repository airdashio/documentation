## Document Structure for Creating Headings
In this particular section, you have the flexibility to personalize your headings in alignment with your individual preferences and requirements. To facilitate this customization process, we have thoughtfully included the sections where modifications can be seamlessly applied within your heading elements.
## Basic usage
By following this structure, create the heading section effectively in your dashboards.
- Required string param **kind** always should be **heading**.
- Required string param **version** is **v1**.
- Required string param **title** your title, for example _Analytics dashboard_.
- Optional string param **subtitle** your title, for example _Monitor metrics, check reports and review performance_.


Incorporate these details into the provided template to create a well-structured heading element.

```json
{
  "kind": "heading",
  "version": "v1",
  "title": "Analytics dashboard",
  "subtitle": "Monitor metrics, check reports and review performance"
